This project is no longer supported, consider using SQLAlchemy or Peewee. It
started as a side project, but due to time constraints and better alternatives,
it didn't make sense to continue work on this project.

The project has been removed from PyPI to free up the name.

Cuttle's connection pool implementation `Cuttle Pool
<https://github.com/smitchell556/cuttlepool>`_ is still active.
